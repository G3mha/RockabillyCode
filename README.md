# RockabillyCode
RockabillyCode is a dynamic and expressive programming language designed to capture the vibrant energy and timeless charm of Elvis Presley's music. It features a syntax that's easy on the eyes, much like the smooth lines of a classic Cadillac, and it's built to encourage developers to be as creative and innovative as Elvis was on stage.
